        In Canada, we profess our loyalty to a person who represents all
        Canadians and not to a document such as a constitution, a banner such as
        a flag, or a geopolitical entity such as a country. In our
        constitutional monarchy, these elements are encompassed by the Sovereign
        (Queen or King). It is a remarkably simple yet powerful principle:
        Canada is personified by the Sovereign just as the Sovereign is
        personified by Canada.
